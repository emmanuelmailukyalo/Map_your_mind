 -Set num2 to third input value

 -if num1 is greater than num2 and num2 is greater than num3
	print num1,num2,num3

 -elseif num3 is greater than num2 and num2 is greater than num1
	print num2,num3,num1

 -elseif num2 is greater than num1 and num1 is greater than num3
	print num2,num1,num3

 -elseif num2 is greater than num3 and num3 is greater than num1
	print num2,num3,num1

 -elseif num1 is greater than num3 and num3 is greater than num2
	print num1,num3,num2

 -else
